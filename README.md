# TA-ME

#Project Title
TA-ME - A source for any help you may need with a web/mobile app project. 

##Description
TA-ME was created for the student who is working on a project while attending a coding bootcamp and needs some extra help on the weekends, or simply needs some extra help getting through a new language or framework. TA-ME provides you with local teacher aides that are currently helping at a coding camp near you and can sit and help you work through your bugs, and answer any questions. Don't stress about trying to find the answers online, let someone with expert knowledge help you out.
